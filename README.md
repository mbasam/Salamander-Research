# Salamander-Research

This is an R repository with a Master Branch that must not be messed with, a long-view file that has all the R chunks in one R Markdown, and individual files with attached HTML files to show specific chunks with better detail. 

The goal of this project is to complete a research project with Occidental College. Anyone who wishes to use part of the code should contact the authors. 

Salamanders r0ck.

Peace.
